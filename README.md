Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing user engagement and content trends within a social media platform. The primary goal is to leverage SQL for extracting meaningful insights from a relational database.
that contains various tables, such as user profiles, posts, comments, likes, followers, and engagement metrics.

Objectives:

1. Analyze User Activity: Identify the most active users, including details on post frequency, comment activity, and average likes received.
2. Content Trend Analysis: Discover the most popular post types (e.g., images, videos, text) and identify trending hashtags over specific periods.
3. Engagement Metrics: Calculate engagement metrics, such as average likes, shares, and comments per post, to understand user interactions.
4. Follower Insights: Analyze follower growth patterns, identify influential users, and explore user demographics.
5. Sentiment Analysis (optional): If text data is available, perform a basic sentiment analysis on comments to understand user sentiment.

Scope of Work:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing or null values in tables.
Normalize data if needed to improve efficiency.

2. Database Schema Design (if applicable):
Define relationships between tables such as users, posts, comments, and likes.

3. SQL Queries:
Write SQL queries to fetch required data, calculate metrics, and aggregate results.
Use subqueries, joins, and window functions to analyze data in-depth.
